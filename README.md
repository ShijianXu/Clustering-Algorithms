# Clustering Algorithms
This repository contains some interesting clustering algorithm. All of them are implemented in Python 3.5

## Models
1. K-Means
2. EM_GMM (EM algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Model)
3. Mean-Shift

## Requirement
1. Python 3.5
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Pillow
5. Some other libs. Find them when you need them :p

## Simple Data Clustering
You can use ```main.py``` to cluster some simple datasets.

## Image Segmentation
You can use ```imgSegMain.py``` to use one of the clustering algorithm to segment images.
